"""Provides ThreadHandler for asynchronous thread operations in Postgres
  . Utilizes psycopg3 for async database access
  . Delegates thread operations to PostgreSQL functions
  . Scopes thread operations by an explicitly supplied restaurant namespace
Functions/Classes:
  . ThreadHandler - Main class for thread management
Key Methods:
  . create_thread - Creates a new thread via PostgreSQL function
  . get_active_thread - Gets active thread and updates last_access_dtts
  . make_threads_inactive - Marks threads as inactive
  . get_stale_active_threads - Lists stale active threads eligible for inactivation
  . get_or_create_thread - Gets existing or creates new thread atomically
  . retain_thread - Sets retain_thread flag to true for active thread
